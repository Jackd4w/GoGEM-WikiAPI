# GoGEM-WikiAPI

The GoGEM Module will enable iGEM Teams to completely design and maintain their Wiki via a WordPress instance.

This Module contains the functions that enable communications with the iGEM-Servers.

I tried commenting the code as best as I can. For more information check out the
repo of [GoGEM](https://github.com/Jackd4w/GoGEM).
